PARAMETERS OF THE SYSTEM

Planet radius = 1.704 R⊕
Planet mass = 4.5 M⊕
Planet temperature = 871 K

Star radius = 0.665 R⊙
Star temperature = 4552 K

Chemistry: 
According to Alderson et al. 2024, the interior of the exoplanet TOI-836 b is compatible with a pure rock composition. From the model used by the authors the planet could be made of  at most 0.1% solar metallity gas or 9±5% pure water.
