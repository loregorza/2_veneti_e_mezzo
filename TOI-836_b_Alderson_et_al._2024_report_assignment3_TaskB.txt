PARAMETERS OF THE SYSTEM

Planet radius = 1.704 R⊕
Planet mass = 4.5 M⊕
Planet temperature = 871 K

Star radius = 0.665 R⊙
Star temperature = 4552 K

Chemistry: 
In the Alderson et al. 2024 paper, the authors considered two possible compositions for the interior 
of TOI-836 b: the first supposes that it has an Earth-like core with a H2-He envelope of solar metallicity,
while in the second one the core is supposed to be refractory with a pure H2O envelope and an atmosphere
on top. According to these scenarios, TOI-836 b could have an envelope mass fraction of at most 0.1% 
in the case of gas of solar composition, or a water mass fraction of 9±5% in the pure H2O case.
